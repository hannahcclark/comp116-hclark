# Final Project

This project investigates how to securely use mobile devices for medical communications potentially involving sensitive information. The code in the folders TransmissionSecurityTester and TransmissionSecurityServer are an iOS app and a Node.js server respectively that were used in testing the security of various communications available to iOS. They may be found in the public repositories:
